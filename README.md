Summary: By no means comprehensive, the Jeju Historical Machines Archive is a project for mechanical history prevention and citizen science. It includes crossbows, muzzle-loading firearms, and others mechanical launchers. The primary objective of this project is to highlight the range of mechanical launchers from across history and the world, primarily from the greater Asia-Pacific region. The primary categories are: crossbows, experimental archeology (historic muzzle loaders and air guns), and science accelerators (newer mechanical launchers). These models are unsuitable for 3D printing.  

Crossbows:
Chinese Repeating Crossbow-The Chinese Repeating Crossbow is dated from the Warring States period. It has been carefully reconstructed. It can be viewed on the GitHub page under tree/master/crossbows/ChineseRepeatingCrossbow.
European Crossbow-The European Crossbow dates from the High Middle Ages (1000 to 1250 AD) and can be viewed on the GitHub under tree/master/crossbows/Europeancrossbow/Crossbow.
Pump Crossbow-A relatively modern (1950s) repeating crossbow, which in experienced hands, can fire 5 shots in 5 seconds. It can be viewed on the GitHub under tree/master/ crossbows/pumpCrossbow.
Lever-Action Crossbow-A crossbow with a Winchester-inspired lever-action cocking system. It, and its arrow projectile, can be found on the GitHub page under tree/master/crossbows/leverCrossbow.

Experimental Archeology:
Dreyse Needle Gun-The Dreyse Needle Gun, which was invented by Johann Nikolaus von Dreyse in 1836, is a German firearm with the first modern firing pin. It can be viewed on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/Germany.
Lorenzoni Rifle-The Lorenzoni Rifle is a breech-loading rifle developed by Michele Lorenzoni, in Florence, in the 1690s. It can be viewed on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/Italy.
Teppo Rifle-The Teppo Rifle is a snap matchlock rifle that was bought over to Japan by the Portuguese and later improved upon throughout the centuries. It saw extensive use during the Sengoku (Warring States) period, which lasted from 1467 to 1615. It can be viewed on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/Japan.
Seonjo Carbine- Developed during the reign of King Seonjo, for use in the Imjin War (1592-1598) against Japan, this matchlock was supposedly able to fire five times before reloading. This reconstruction was presumed to use a superposed load. It can be found on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/Korea.
Lantaka-A bronze swivel hand cannon, developed and deployed in Malaysia and other Southeast Asian countries, from the 13th to late 19th centuries. It was even still used by remote Moro tribes into the 20th century. It can be found on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/Malay.
Jezail-Often a handmade rifle common to Central and South Asia. It saw extensive use in the Anglo-Afghan Wars in the 1800s, to the point that Rudyard Kipling and Arthur Conan Doyle frequently mentioned it in their writings. It can be found on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/southAsia.
Colt 1851 Navy Revolver-Developed by Samuel Colt, between 1847-1850, is a cap and ball revolver that saw extensive use in the American Civil War. It can be viewed on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/US/cap/Navy1851.
1836 Paterson Pistol-The Colt Paterson Revolver is the first ball and cap revolver, developed by Samuel Colt. It was a massive game changer for the US Army in their campaigns against the Native American tribes. It can be viewed on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/US/cap/Paterson1836.
Rebley Pistol-The Rebley Pistol uses a Remington 1858 cylinder with a British Webley revolver frame. It can be viewed on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/UK.
‘Miskatonic’ Pistol- A pistol dating from New Zealand Land Wars between the British and the Maori people from the 1840s to the 1870s. This particular model’s working name comes from Lovecraft’s fictional Miskatonic University. It can be viewed on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/NZ.
‘Nehebkau’ Pistol-A double barrel flintlock pistol converted to percussion cap, dating from the New Zealand Land Wars. Nicknamed for the double-headed Egyptian snake god that guarded the underworld. It can be viewed on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/NZ.
Belton Flintlock Rifle-One of the first repeating rifles, designed by Joseph Belton, for use by the Continental Army during the American Revolution. This rifle could fire eight rounds in as many seconds, through the use of a superposed load. It can be found on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/US/flint
San Yan Chong (Three-Eyed Cannon)-A unique handheld ‘cannon’ from the Ming Dynasty of China (1368-1644). This weapon was formatted in a triangular shape to allow its user to fire multiple times before reloading, in part to make up for its poor accuracy. Despite the introduction of matchlock firearms, this weapon still service till the end of the dynasty. It can be found on the GitHub under tree/master/ experimentalArch/china.
Girandoni Air Gun-An Austrian air rifle from the late 1700s also used by the Lewis and Clark expedition. It can be found on the GitHub under tree/master/experimentalArch/austria.

Science Accelerators:
Ganymede Pneumatic Cannister Launcher-The Ganymede was a device to launch projectiles pneumatically, specifically 12g CO2 cannisters. It can be found on GitHub in under tree/master/scienceAccelerators/pneumatic.
Sophia Powder-Actuated System-Sophia was a modular system for experimental archeology and prototyping pneumatic and powder-actuated tools. It was based around a custom muzzleloader that can be swapped to other configurations. It, and its accessories, can be found on the GitHub under tree/master/scienceAccelerators/sophiaLite/sophia36.
Salvo Sling-The Salvo sling is a mechanical slingshot driven by an elastic band. It has a trigger and ratchet mechanism to hold a cup backwards. It can be found on the GitHub under tree/master/scienceAccelerators/mechanical. 
Puaka (Projected Utility Active Kinetic Accelerator)-The Puaka is a centrifugal launcher driven by belt sander flywheel. A tool version is available as the toolPuaka. A stylized version is available as the modelPuaka. It can be found on the GitHub under tree/master/scienceAccelerators/centrifugal.
